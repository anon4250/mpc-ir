    Computes biometric matching

    This version uses some preprocessed data from parties to provide faster biometric matching

    :param int D: the cardinality of a feature vector, Usually small, e.g. 4
    :param int N: number of features in the database e.g. usually 1024, 2048, 4096, etc
    :param list[int] C: query feature vector, we need to find closest match to this vector in the DB, comes from client (Alice)
    :param int C_sqr_sum: sum of squares of elements of `C` e.g. if `C={1, 2, 3, 4}`, then `C_sqr_sum is: 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4 = 30`
     client passes it pre-processed to to save gates in circuit
    :param list[int] two_C: same as `C` except that each element is multipled by 2, e.g. if `C={1, 2, 3, 4}`, then
     `two_C = {2, 4, 6, 8}`. client passes it preprocessed to save gates
    :param list[int] S: the database of features, it has N * D elements i.e. N features and each feature vector has D elements,
     this comes from server (Bob)
    :param list[int] S_sqr_sum: has N elements, each element is sum of squares of corresponding feature elements e.g. say
     S={{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}}, then S_sqr_sum={1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4, 5*5 + 6*6 + 7*7 + 8*8} = {30, 174}
